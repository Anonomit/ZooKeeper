<h1>2.0.0</h1>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mounting as a druid now uses an appropriate shadpeshift form if it makes more sense (combat, swimming, moving, etc.). This is currently not configurable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Old slash commands no longer work, due to the Collection Log.</li>
  <ul> 
    <li>Mounting is now done with <strong>/click ZKM</strong> (ZooKeeper Mount).</li>
    <li>Summoning a pet is now done with <strong>/click ZKP</strong> (ZooKeeper Pet).</li>
    <li>It is no longer possible to specify a certain type (ground/fly/swim) or speed of mount. You may still set favorite mounts and the addon will use them unless a faster one is found.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Favorite pets have been reset due to Blizzard moving to a different way of storing pets. Favorite mounts have been preserved.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Updated to work with the new Collection Log.</li>
</ul>
